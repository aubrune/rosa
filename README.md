This repository contains the arduino code for the robot. There is two versions at the moment. One working using serial communication and the other one uses websocket.

You will also find a minimal Python API to control the robot with a follow line example.

You can also find a python utility that can be used to exposes the serial port as a websocket. It's useful for communicating with the Scratch 3 extension.
